                    ü§ù Group Project: because sharing is caring ü§ù
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of my fondest memories from school were group projects,
                    where famously, everyone shared the load equally and I was{" "}
                    <em>not</em> stuck doing someone else‚Äôs slides at 2am the
                    night before the presentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this project, I wanted to encapsulate that group
                    project energy. I used websockets to make every setting
                    global, because sharing is caring. If you pause the video,
                    we all pause. If you watch the video at full volume in a
                    public space, we‚Äôre all watching it at full volume right
                    there with ya.
                </p>
                <p>There are a few additional niceties here. </p>
                <p>
                    First is <strong>playback rate</strong>. We had a dilemma
                    here. A point on the earth spins faster at the equator, and
                    slower the farther North or South you get. To solve this
                    problem, I adjusted the playback rate to be a global average
                    value based on the latitude of all connected users. To
                    influence this value, move to a different latitude.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To set the <strong>volume</strong>, you need to make a noise
                    inversely proportional to the volume you want. So, a loud
                    sound produces a quiet volume setting. For example, if
                    you're in a library and you'd like a quiet volume to match
                    the environment, you must scream. This value is also shared
                    between all users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this video player, the efforts of one affect the
                    experience of all. I hope this allows you to revisit the
                    feeling of resting in confidence that 33% of your final
                    grade is in the hands of Brad from the lacrosse team.
